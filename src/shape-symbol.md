
## Symbol

A symbol shape acts as a link, displaying a thumbnail of its target shapes.

When you create a symbol shape, it generates and saves an SVG image in the workspace. All Symbol shapes that reference the same target shapes share this SVG image.

### Creating a Symbol

To create a symbol shape for selected shapes, choose `Create symbol` from the context menu.

### Jumping to Target Shapes

You can quickly navigate to the target shapes by clicking the `Jump` button on the canvas.

> **Note:** Jumping is available only when both the target shapes and the symbol shape are on the same sheet.

### Updating a Symbol

Symbol shapes do not automatically update to reflect changes in their target shapes. To refresh the thumbnail, manually click the `Update` button on the canvas,

or select `Update symbol` from the context menu.

All symbol shapes referencing the same target will be updated simultaneously.

> **Note:** Updating is only possible when both the target shapes and the symbol shape are on the same sheet.
