## Sheet Image

Sheet image shapes display thumbnail images of the sheets they refer to.

### Add

To add a new sheet image shape, click the `Create shape` option in the sheet tool dropdown. This will add the shape to the current sheet.

### Limitation

Sheet thumbnails are generated as static image files after any operation occurs in a sheet. As a result, they may not always reflect the latest appearance of sheets containing sheet image shapes.  
To update a thumbnail, open the sheet and make any modification. Alternatively, you can trigger thumbnail generation by pressing `Ctrl + s` (or `âŒ˜ + s` on Mac).
