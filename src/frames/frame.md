### Name
Each frame shape can have name that is displayed near by. This name is visible only in the canvas and isn't printed out.

### Move
Shapes on the frame move along with the frame. You can also move selected frame shape without moving other shapes by shift-dragging.  
When frame shapes have overlapping part, it's unstable which shapes on that part belong to.

Frame shapes don't move by dragging unless they're already selected before dragging.

### Order
Frame shapes are always placed at the backmost position in the canvas except for frame groups.

### Grouping
Frame shapes can belong to frame groups only. They can't belong to other shapes such as group shapes or align box shapes.

### Export
Shapes on the frame are exported as part of the frame.

## Frame group
