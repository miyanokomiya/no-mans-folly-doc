# Lists

List styles are applied to the current line when an activation key is pressed after specific characters.

By default, the activation keys are either `Space` or `Tab`. Activation is canceled when the `Shift` key is held.  
The `Shift` key behavior can be reversed by setting `List Detection` to `Reverse` in the settings panel.

You can also apply or clear list styles using the list style panel in the floating menu.

## Bullet List

Activating with `-` or `*` starts a bullet list.

## Ordered List

Activating with `1.`, `2.`, and so on starts an ordered list. The markers are automatically determined in the list.

## Empty List

Pressing `Shift + Enter` breaks the list line without adding a list marker to the new line.
