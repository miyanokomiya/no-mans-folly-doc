## Functionalities of frame shapes

### Order
Frame shapes are always placed at the backmost position in the canvas.

### Name
Each frame shape can have name that is displayed by the frame. This name is visible only in the canvas and isn't printed out.

### Move
Frame shapes don't move by dragging unless they're already selected before dragging.  
Shapes on the frame move along with the frame. You can also move selected frame shape without moving other shapes by shift-dragging.

### Ristrictions
Frame shapes can't belong to other shapes such as group shapes or align box shapes.

When frame shapes have overlapping part, it's unstable which shapes on that part belong to.

### Export
Shapes on the frame are exported as part of the frame.
