## Local workspace
[File System API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_System_API) is essential to use local workspace.

If you see `This browser doesn't support local folder.` in the entrance dialog, your browser probably doesn't support the API. Most browser for mobile devices don't support the API.

Some browsers, such as [Brave](https://brave.com/), may turn off the API by default. In such case, you may be able to turn it on manually in the browser side.

The dialog looks like this when local workspace is available.
